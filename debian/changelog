rumd (3.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * bugfix release
  * src/rumd_algorithms.cu: Fix for bug introduced by fix of parallel
    reduction bug (involving overwriting other arrays when
    numParticles not a power of 2).
  * updates for AxilrodTellerPotential

 -- Heine Larsen <heinela@ruc.dk>  Thu, 02 Jun 2016 14:03:29 +0200

rumd (3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new minor release
  * A new integrator, IntegratorNPTAtomic which simulates the NPT ensemble
    for atomic systems (combined barostat + thermostat)
  * A specialized pair potential for Coulomb interactions: Pot_ShiftedForceCoulomb
    (instead of using IPL_n with n=1). The long range part of the Coulomb
    interaction is omitted but for bulk systems this is not a problem.
  * Performance optimizations: for large molecular systems due to better updating
    after sorting, for general molecular systems due to better exclusion list processing,
    and faster intra molecular forces (atomicAdd), and for systems with multiple
    pair potentials (atomicAdd).
  * New rumd_init_conf tool for creating configuration files for atomic systems
    in a variety of crystal lattices (older ones such as rumd_init_conf_FCC are still
    present but deprecated).
  * Upgraded tool for creating configuration files for molecular systems, renamed
    from rumd_sfg to rumd_init_conf_mol
  * Ability to set particle masses within python script (as opposed to hacking the
    configuration file)
  * Python module and function RunCompress to gently change density (particularly
    useful when setting up molecular configurations)
  * Some changes in the Python paths/package structure. Setting paths is slightly
    simpler, but requires changes to existing scripts.
  * Two bugs fixed: (1) A race condition to non-thread-safe implementation of
    parallel reduction summation used in the thermostat. This was manifest as
    occasional slight jumps in the energy for large systems, but had minimal effect
    on physically relevant quantities. (2) Certain combinations of lengths for
    non-cubic boxes were incorrectly recognized (simulated as cubic boxes).
  * Removed restriction on order for adding pair potentials versus molecular forces
    (exclusions correctly implemented either way)
  * More output is under control of "verbose" flag
  * LESB and RSB now at same level in inheritance tree, removes confusion when
    identifying type
  * debian packaging fixes for python-rumd to properly include the python code

rumd (2.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * bugfix release
  * Compatible with CUDA 5.5.
  * Minor problems with paths fixed.
  * Some limits on system sizes in molecular systems removed.
  * New tests added.
  * Two small bugs fixed: one involving correct accounting of periodic images
    in sheared systems which affected the calculation of the moecular stress,
    the other involving the degrees of the freedom not being correctly determined
    following a restart.
  * Features added to analysis tools.
  * Some other small improvements.

rumd (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new release
  * Main new features:
  * Memory optimizations to allow over a million particles (atomic systems
    only for now though, no molecules)
  * SLLOD equations of motion integrator for molecular systems (using the
    molecular formulation of the SLLOD algorithm and thermostat)
  * User-defined "runtime" actions to be included in the main loop
  * TetheredGroup class for manipulating tethering a group of particles to
    a set of lattice sites by springs.
  * Support for more types, maximum number of types is now 16 by default.
  * Improvements to the autotuner (speed and reliability)
  * Newton's third law now assumed by default, so not necessary to call
    SetParams for both i,j and j,i.
  * Improvements to analysis tools.

      http://rumd.org/ soon.

rumd (1.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/BondPotential.cu: Fixed bug: Double potential energy counting
    in Harmonic bond potential and FENE bond potential kernels. This
    only showed up if the bond potential was not the last potential
    that was added to the simulation.

rumd (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * src/PairPotential.cu: Shifted-force/virial bug fix to 1.2 release
    branch

 -- Heine Larsen <heinela@ruc.dk>  Thu, 28 Jun 2012 15:26:18 +0200

rumd (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * bugfix release
  * Python/rumdSimulation.py: Bug fix for release 1.2. Re-setting
    of momentum to zero has been decoupled from the callback
    mechanism for used-defined output functions, which means it
    now functions correctly again after restarts. The user-defined
    callback functions do not, however.
  * src/Makefile: remove hardcoded -m64 option to allow compiling
    on i386
